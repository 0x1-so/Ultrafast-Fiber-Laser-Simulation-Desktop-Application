# 🚀 Ultrafast Fiber Laser Simulation Desktop Application

## Introduction

This project is a desktop application designed for simulating ultrafast fiber lasers. It provides a user-friendly simulation environment, allowing users to simulate the behavior of ultrafast fiber lasers, modify simulation parameters in real-time, and monitor the simulation status at any time.

## Features

- **🔬 Fiber Laser Simulation**: Simulate the operation of ultrafast fiber lasers with high accuracy.
- **💻 User-Friendly Interface**: Easily construct various laser systems as if working in the real world.
- **📚 Extensive Fiber Library**: Access a comprehensive library of fiber components with accurate simulation capabilities.
- **🧩 Auto Laser Cavity Detection**: Automatically detect if the constructed cavity forms a laser cavity.
- **🔍 Auto Amplification Mode Detection**: Automatically detect if the user wants to simulate an amplifier.
- **📈 Pulse Amplification and Compression Module**: Simulate pulse amplification and compression processes.
- **💾 Save and Load Configurations**: Save and load cavity configurations and results.
- **⚙️ Real-time Parameter Adjustment**: Modify simulation parameters, including fiber component parameters (such as reflectivity and dispersion of FBG, fiber length of fiber components), in real-time.
- **📊 Status Check**: Check the simulation status at any point in time.

## Usage
